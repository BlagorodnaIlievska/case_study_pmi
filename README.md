  - data_exploration.ipynb for general overview of the data
  - baseline_classifier.ipynb as a starting point
  - categorical_feature_engineering_exploration.ipynb for binning the categorical features 
  - improved_classifiers_using_binned_features.ipynb for bulding additional models using the binned features
  - encode_test_set.ipynb for mapping the encoding in the train set to the test set
  - new_score_data.xlsx a test set for checking the model performances
